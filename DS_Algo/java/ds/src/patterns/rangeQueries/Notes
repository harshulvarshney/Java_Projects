for a given array: [4,3,5,7,-1,2,8,6,5,9] of length 10
query-1: find the sum in range (3,6)
query-2: find the min in range (2,5)

Above question can be answered in many ways:
1- traverse the input array and find the answer, time complexity : O(n), space complexity: (1)
2- prepare a 2D matrix of size 10 by 10, time complexity: O(1), space complexity: O(n-square), time in preparing matrix: O(n-square)

3-

4- Segment Tree
    works for all functions: min, max, gcd, sum, multiplication etc...
    array can be mutable
    pre-processing based solution
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    Tree Construction: O(n)
    Update element: O(log n)
    Time Complexity: O(log n)

4- Sparse Table
    works only for functions like min, max, gcd etc...
    array must be immutable (i.e. array must not be updated between 2 queries)
    pre-processing based solution
    Space Complexity: O(n log n)
    Time Complexity:  O(1)

Diff Between Strategy and Factory:
A factory pattern is a creational pattern - A strategy pattern is an behavioral pattern.
A factory pattern is used to create objects of a specific type - A strategy pattern is use to perform an operation.

In fact the two can be used together. For example, you may have a factory that creates your business objects. 
It may use different strategies based on the persistence medium. If your data is stored locally in XML it would 
use one strategy. If the data were remote in a different database, it would use another.

Strategy pattern is often used together with Factory Method, 
while Factory Method is often used for instantiation of other stereotypes, not only Strategies.
